#WARNING: This next command produces a long screen output of >200 lines. Therefore, I have kept it from running in this Markdown document. However, if you let it run, you will see that it is just the type of un-parsed data we want to parse in order to interrogate for the player names, or whatever.
#
#xmlSApply (NflRootNode, xmlValue)
#
#I used the following command to try and get the player names (copied from Dr. McGee, with replacement for my data names).
#
#players <- xpathSApply (NflXml, "//li(@class='name')", xmlValue)
#
#The code inside the "" marks is what she used to take out the delimiters in the output from the xmlSApply function, but looking at the code from <xmlSApply (NflRootNode)> I don't see any of that. And I couldn't identify any other pattern that I came across in the materials I reviewed for xml parsing. So I was stuck there.
#I tried putting the output from the xmlSApply function into a data set, as follows below, but that didn't give data that could be interrogated. Maybe I should have formatted the data set.
nfldata <- xmlSApply (NflRootNode, xmlValue)
dim(nfldata)
class(nfldata)
str(nfldata)
# xmlSApply (nfldata, xmlValue). This produced the following error message: 
#"No applicable method for 'xmlSApply' applied to an object of class "character""
#I checked its class to be sure, and it is just "character".

#Good luck. Let me know if you solve it.
